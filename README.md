# QIS
Quantum information scrambling  and quantum chaos repository for semiconductor quantum dot arrays

Study quantum information scrambling for different quantum encodings through modelling of tripartite mutual information dynamics of unitary evolution quantum channel (entanglement in time) and 4-point out-of-time order correlators (OTOCs)
